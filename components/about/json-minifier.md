### What is a JSON Minifier?

A JSON Minifier is a tool designed to compress JSON data by eliminating unnecessary white space, line breaks, and indentation. This results in a minimized version of the JSON file which is useful for reducing payload sizes in network requests and for saving storage space.


### How does a JSON Minifier work?

A JSON Minifier systematically scans JSON data, removing all irrelevant characters that are not required for parsing. These typically include whitespace, new lines, and sometimes comments, depending on the minifier's capability.

#### Example of JSON Minification

Consider the following example:

**Input JSON:**
```json
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "email": "jane.doe@example.com"
}
```

**Output Minified JSON:**
```json
{"name":"Jane Doe","age":25,"email":"jane.doe@example.com"}
```

As you can see, the minified output has no unnecessary spaces or line breaks, making it compact and efficient for transmission.

### Which programming languages have JSON Minification functions?

Many programming languages have libraries or functions to minify JSON, such as:

- JavaScript: `JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(json))`
- Python: `json.dumps(json.loads(json_string), separators=(',', ':'))`
- PHP: `json_encode(json_decode($json, true), JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES | JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE)`
