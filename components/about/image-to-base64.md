### What is Image to Base64 Conversion?

Converting an image to Base64 transforms it from binary data to a text string format, making it embeddable in web pages or for use in APIs. This process is crucial for seamless image integration without the need for additional image hosting.

### How does Image to Base64 Conversion work?

This conversion reads your image's binary content and encodes it into a text-based Base64 string. This text string encapsulates all the image data, ensuring it can be transmitted or stored in places that don't support binary data.

#### Example of Image to Base64 Conversion

**Input Image:** `picture.jpg`

**Output Base64 String:**
```base64
/data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/...
```

This Base64 string can be used directly within HTML or CSS, or stored as text in databases.

### Which programming languages support Image to Base64 conversion?

Many languages include support for this conversion:

- JavaScript: `FileReader.readAsDataURL()`
- Python: `base64.b64encode(open('image.jpg', 'rb').read()).decode()`
- PHP: `base64_encode(file_get_contents('image.jpg'))`
